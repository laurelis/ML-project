(These are the same dataset, just from different websites.)


I will use a ML to see if we can predict the malignancy of breast tumors based on
the following tumor traits: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, 
concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. Which factor has the most weight?

I hope to have a webpage summarizing the data and graphs run on a local Python server.

Will also be using jupyter notebook for the ML portion.
	- Goal is classification: tumor is malignant or benign.
	- Model will be trained on supervised data.

Oct 19th: Clean data in Python or Amazon (looks like it's fairly cleaned already.)
Oct 21st: Set up the ML/train/save model -> are their any perks to using TensorFlow for this?
	Be sure to determine the accuracy and precision of the model. 
Oct 23rd: Data exploration; are their specific factors of a tumor that determine malignancy? 
Oct 26th: Create an aesthetic visualization of the data.
