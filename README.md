# ML PROJECT: BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS

The purpose of this project was to create a ML model that can predict whether a tumor mass is malignant or benign based on certain features of the tumor cell's nucleus. I trained a Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a Deep Neural Network model and compared scores of each model. Also, I created a simplified Logistic Regression model, limiting the number of features necessary for a fairly precise diagnosis.

I trained my model on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Features in this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
